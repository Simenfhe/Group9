Music production for video games
==========

What the project is about
-----------
This project will teach music production in a way that is centered around music in videogames. We will go over a few different techniques and some software, we will also show a few examples of how music is produced, and then used in videogames.

This project will have 10 scenes about learning how to get into it.

Why it is useful
-----------
There isn't many easily accessible resources for music production around videogames. It is also related to UN sustainabiltiy goals, and the fourth goal specifically:
Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.
